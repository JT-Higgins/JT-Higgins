As a Computer Science student at Colorado State University, I am deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and humanity, striving to leverage this synergy to drive meaningful and innovative outcomes.

My academic journey has been complemented by a diverse range of roles, including research with Project Sustain, an internship at Oracleâ€™s Machine Learning Lab, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and experience as a Teaching Assistant. These opportunities have allowed me to develop strong expertise in languages such as Java, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript, while also gaining competency in C, C++, Swift, and Julia, among others.

Beyond the classroom, I find joy in hands-on projects, whether it's experimenting with 3D printing, diving into Arduino-based innovations, or exploring the great outdoors through snowboarding, soccer, and camping. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also reflect my commitment to a well-rounded and dynamic approach to life.

I am eager to contribute to projects in software engineering, machine learning, AI, and neurotechnology, and I am dedicated to continual growth and learning. I believe that embracing challenges and learning from them is key to true innovation.

If you share a passion for advancing technology in impactful ways and enjoy a collaborative, energetic environment, I would love to connect. The future holds immense potential, and I am excited to be a part of shaping it.
